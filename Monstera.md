- It's best to not let the soil dry out too much because its leaves will start to droop. When this happens, you need to water the plant as soon as possible, because your Monstera is at risk of drying out. Another sign that your plant is starting to dry out is when you notice brown and crispy edges on the leaves. 
- If you water the Monstera too much or too often, the plant will also tell you. When you overwater the monster, its leaves will turn yellow."
